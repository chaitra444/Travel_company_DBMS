project name Travel Agency Database System

• A database management system is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.

• A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.

• The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible. DBMS include change management, performance monitoring/tuning and backup and recovery. 

• Many database management systems are also responsible for automated rollbacks, restarts and recovery as well as the logging and auditing of activity.

• The DBMS can offer both logical and physical data independence. That means it can protect users and applications from needing to know where data is stored or having to be concerned about changes to the physical structure of data.
